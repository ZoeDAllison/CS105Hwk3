# The Raiders have not been successful for years now
## They struggle every year, sometimes barely making the playoffs
### They haven't made the Super Bowl since 2002 when they lost to the Buccaneers 
#### They just relocated to Las Vegas this year after being Oakland for the past 25 seasons
#####Currently they are 2-1 after coming off a lost against the Patriots
###### But they look to bounce back this Sunday againat the undefeated Bills
